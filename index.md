## About Me

I am a 2nd year graduate student majoring in computer science at Peking University, advised by Prof. Yuexian Zou. Previously, I received a B.A. in Environmental Engineering from Sun Yat-sen University. 

I am generally interested in enhancing the general capabilities of Vision-language Models (VLMs) and developing trustworthy AI agents.
